# My First Backend

This is my first project creating a backend application utilizing a light web framework. For this project Express was used.
This project was completed on October 7, 2021.

***

## Getting Started

This is a fairly simple backend project to familiarize myself with Curl and Express. No database was used for this project.


## Installation

To get started, please install the below packages to get the development environment up and running.

```
$ npm install express
$ npm install express-basic-auth
```

## Usage

First begin by kicking off the server. Then implement a simple get request on '/' or one of the other methods defined in the source code.

1. Launch Server - `$ node app.js`
2. Check the various routes on your local host, port 8080.
3. Implement a get request via curl to test from command line.
